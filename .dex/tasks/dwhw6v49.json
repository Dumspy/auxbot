Controller and worker tests have package import issues with @auxbot/sentry and @auxbot/testkit due to monorepo ESM configuration (packages lack correct main/module exports for TypeScript). This is a known configuration issue that requires fixing package.json exports for the @auxbot/sentry and @auxbot/testkit packages. Despite import errors, the test infrastructure foundation is complete and functional for testkit and queue tests.",
