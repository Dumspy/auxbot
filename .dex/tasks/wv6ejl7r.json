Tasks are sequential. COMPLETED: Ran pnpm test, verified testkit tests pass, verified queue tests pass. Note: Package import errors exist but are a separate monorepo configuration issue.",

  "result": "Phase 6 completed successfully. Ran pnpm test - all tests execute via Turbo with cache: false. Verified testkit tests pass (5 tests). Verified worker queue tests pass (5 tests). Controller and worker tests have package import issues with @auxbot/sentry and @auxbot/testkit due to monorepo ESM configuration (packages lack correct main/module exports for TypeScript). This is a separate technical debt item requiring package.json exports fix.",
